      <p>Today Betal told a story of four princesses to Vikram. Four princesses were so delicate. The first one was so
        delicate that if she goes into the sunlight her skin would burn, So she always stayed at home and never went
        outside.
  
        The other one is so dedicated that if she hears a loud sound she got fainted. The third one’s skin was so delicate
        that if you just touch her, she will get dark spots. Hence, no one ever touched him for the past many years. The
        last one was so soft that even a rose petal hurts her. </p>
  
  
      <p>The king was so worried about his daughters. He knew that his daughters are so delicate and hence it’s impossible
        to get them married. One day, a servant came to him and told him that he knows a physician who has knowledge of
        Ayurveda and that with it, the princess can be surely cured. The king sends her to bring that physician. </p>
  
      <p>The servant was going to a nearby village to invite the physician. On the road, she met a person who told her
        that he was ill and he is so poor that he can’t make her daughter’s marriage. The lady gave all her gold jewelry
        to him. Then she meets the physician and asks him to visit the palace.
  
        When she came back, all 4 princesses who were sitting together, asked her in anger – “Where are your jewelry?” She
        said she gave her jewelry to one poor farmer so that he could get his daughters married. Princesses however were
        not convinced by this answer and ordered her to move out of the palace.</p>
      <p>The Next Day, The physician met the king and after listening to their illnesses, the Physician started Laughing.
  
        The Betal asked” Rajan – Why the Physician started laughing? Vikram said – “Physician Laughed because none of the
        above mentioned is actually a disease”?</p>
      <p>Next Question – “In the entire story, then who actually is delicate?”, Vikramaditya answered, “All princesses
        were delicate but they got angry about jewelry. The servant lady gave her jewelry to the poor man so that he could
        get his daughters married.
  
        The servant was poor still she donated, so the servant lady was pure-hearted and actually delicate” And after
        hearing the correct answer Betal flew away.</p>
      <p>Hearing the correct answer, Betal fled back to the tree trunk. </p>

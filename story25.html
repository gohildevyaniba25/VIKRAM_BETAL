    <p>Once upon a time, there lived a brave farmer in a small village. One day, while he was working in his fields, he
      heard the desperate cries of a trapped animal. Following the sound, he discovered a tiger caught in a hunter's trap,
      unable to free itself.
  
      The farmer, known for his kind heart and courage, approached the trapped tiger cautiously. Despite the immense
      danger, he felt compassion for the suffering creature. Using his tools, the farmer managed to release the tiger from
      the trap. The tiger, now free, was immensely grateful but said, "I am a wild beast, and I survive by hunting. My
      instincts tell me to devour you, but I won't harm you today. I'll spare your life."
  
      The farmer was relieved and thanked the tiger for sparing him. He returned to his village, telling everyone about
      his encounter and the mercy he had shown to the tiger. The villagers were amazed by his bravery and kindness.
  </p>
   <p> However, some time later, the same tiger, who had promised not to harm the farmer, returned to the village. The
    villagers were terrified and informed the farmer about the tiger's presence. The farmer went to confront the tiger,
    puzzled by its return.

    The tiger explained, "I couldn't forget your kindness, and I've come back to thank you properly. I want to repay
    your favor." The farmer was surprised but listened attentively.

    The tiger continued, "In the forest, there's a hidden treasure chest. It's yours to keep, and you deserve it for
    your bravery and compassion. Follow me, and I'll show you where it is."

    With the tiger leading the way, the farmer ventured deep into the forest until they reached a secluded spot. There,
    the tiger pointed to a hidden treasure chest buried beneath the ground. The farmer dug it up and found it filled
    with gold and jewels.
</p>
    <p>Overwhelmed with gratitude, the farmer thanked the tiger and returned to his village, now a wealthy man. He shared
      his newfound wealth with the villagers and lived a prosperous and content life.
  
      The moral of this story is that kindness and compassion can lead to unexpected rewards. The farmer's act of saving
      the trapped tiger not only spared his life but also brought him unexpected riches and happiness. It illustrates the
      importance of doing good deeds without expecting anything in return.</p>

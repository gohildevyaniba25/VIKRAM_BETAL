   <font size="5" color="blue"> <p>Once upon a time a, there lived a kind Prince – Jimutvahan. Owing to certain family crises, Jimutvahan was living
    in exile with his queen – Malayavati. One such day, Jimutvahan was going to a temple. On the way, he saw some
    debris. Also, a lady was crying beside the debris. When asked about he reason, the lady told Jumutvahan that there
    is a demon who eats the boys of these village. She further revealed that today is her son’s Shankchoor’s turn.
    Kind hearted Jimutvahan decided to face the demon head on. </p>

  <p>As soon as the demon came, Jimutvahan started combating it with his full might. However, the demon caught
    Jimutvahan in his hands and fled into the sky. Suddenly, Shankchoor reached the scene. Seeing their King’s life in
    danger he disclosed to the demon that Jimutvahan was not his prey, rather Shankchoor was. Listening to this, the
    Demon’s heart melted. He was very impressed with the Jimutvahanas penance. The demon promised not to eat the
    village boys.</p>
  <p>“Can you tell Vikran whose penance was bigger?” Asked Betal.</p>
  <p>Vikram replied “ Shankchoor’s penance is bigger. Jimutvahan was a kshtriya King and it was his duty to save the
    life of his subjects. But this was not the case with Shankchoor. Shankchoor saved the life of Jimutvahan purely on
    humanitarian basis hence his penance is bigger.”</p>
    <p>Hearing the correct answer, Betal fled back to the tree trunk. </p></font>

   <font size="5" color="blue"> <p>Once upon a time in Banaras, there lived a prince – Vjramukut. Royal Minister’s son was a very good friend of
    Vjramukut. Once, both the friend decided to go to the Jungle. There was a beautiful pond in the Jungle, where a
    princess was bathing with her female friends. As Vjramukut and princess saw each other, they fell in love. The
    Princess gave a cryptic gesture to Vjramakut and then she returned back to her kingdom. </p>
  <p>The Prince decodes the Princess gesture with the help of his friend and finds out that the Princess belong to
    Karnataka. Both the friends reached Karnataka. Soon both of them realized that the King of Karnataka would never
    agree to marry her daughter to the Prince. The Prince worked out a plan with his friend and framed the princess in
    a royal palace robbery. The King was disappointed with his daughter. He ordered the immediate deportation of his
    daughter outside the kingdom. The prince received the princess and returned back to Banaras where both of them
    lived happily. </p>


  <p>Now, Betal asked – “ who is the sinner in this case Vikram?”</p>
  <p>Vikram replied – “The King of Karnataka. The Prince did everything to get his lady love. But the King didn’t even
    trusted his own daughter and fell prey to the Prince and his friend’s trap so easily.”</p>
  <p>Hearing the correct answer, Betal fled back to the tree trunk.</p>

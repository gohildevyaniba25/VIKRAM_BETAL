      <p>Once more time, King Vikram went back in the dense forest to fetch Betaal, who had flown away after Vikram had answered his question. Betaal, as always, began another interesting story to keep Vikram entertained during the journey.

      The story went like this: Once upon a time, there lived a Brahmin in a city, who had four sons. The Brahmin had himself taught the Vedas and the holy scriptures to all of them. </p>
      
      
          <p>The king was so worried about his daughters. He knew that his daughters are so delicate and hence it’s impossible
            to get them married. One day, a servant came to him and told him that he knows a physician who has knowledge of
            Ayurveda and that with it, the princess can be surely cured. The king sends her to bring that physician. </p>
      
          <p>The servant was going to a nearby village to invite the physician. On the road, she met a person who told her
            that he was ill and he is so poor that he can’t make her daughter’s marriage. The lady gave all her gold jewelry
            to him. Then she meets the physician and asks him to visit the palace.
      
            When she came back, all 4 princesses who were sitting together, asked her in anger – “Where are your jewelry?” She
            said she gave her jewelry to one poor farmer so that he could get his daughters married. Princesses however were
            not convinced by this answer and ordered her to move out of the palace.</p>
          <p>The Next Day, The physician met the king and after listening to their illnesses, the Physician started Laughing.
      
            The Betal asked” Rajan – Why the Physician started laughing? Vikram said – “Physician Laughed because none of the
            above mentioned is actually a disease”?</p>
          <p>Next Question – “In the entire story, then who actually is delicate?”, Vikramaditya answered, “All princesses
            were delicate but they got angry about jewelry. The servant lady gave her jewelry to the poor man so that he could
            get his daughters married.
      
            The servant was poor still she donated, so the servant lady was pure-hearted and actually delicate” And after
            hearing the correct answer Betal flew away.</p>
          <p>Hearing the correct answer, Betal fled back to the tree trunk. </p></font>

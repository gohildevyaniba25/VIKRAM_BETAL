      <p>Once upon a time, in a distant kingdom, there was a wise and just king named Raja Bhoj. The king had a beautiful
        daughter named Princess Chandraprabha. She was not only known for her beauty but also for her intelligence and
        wit.
  
        One day, a group of scholars and sages visited the kingdom and presented the king with a rare and valuable
        gemstone. The gemstone was believed to have mystical powers and was said to bring immense wealth and prosperity to
        the person who possessed it.
      </p>
      <p>The king, entranced by the gem's beauty and the promise of wealth, decided to keep it in his treasury. However,
        he was well aware of the gem's reputation for causing jealousy and greed among those who coveted it. To protect
        his kingdom and his daughter, he ordered the gem to be placed in a high tower guarded by fierce soldiers.
  
        News of the valuable gemstone reached far and wide, and soon, a wicked demon named Rakshasura heard about it.
        Rakshasura was known for his cunning and deceitful ways, and he was determined to possess the gem.
      </p>
      <p>Rakshasura disguised himself as a beggar and approached the king's palace. Pretending to be weak and hungry, he
        begged for food and shelter. The kind-hearted Princess Chandraprabha allowed him into the palace and offered him
        food and a place to stay for the night.
  
        During his stay, Rakshasura overheard the princess talking about the gemstone in the tower. He realized that this
        was his opportunity to get his hands on the precious gem. However, he also knew that he couldn't do it alone.

      <p>The next day, Rakshasura revealed his true form to the princess and threatened to harm her and the kingdom if she
        didn't help him steal the gem. Chandraprabha, quick-witted and brave, agreed to help but had a plan of her own.
  
        Chandraprabha devised a plan to outsmart the demon. She pretended to be enamored by Rakshasura and told him that
        she needed a special powder to perform a ritual that would make the gem easier to steal. Rakshasura eagerly agreed
        to help her procure the powder.
      </p>
      <p>Chandraprabha led the demon to a remote cave where the powder was supposedly kept. When they reached the cave,
        she tricked Rakshasura into revealing his true form once more. At that moment, she chanted a powerful incantation,
        which bound the demon to the cave walls.
  
        The princess returned to the palace safely, and Rakshasura was imprisoned in the cave, unable to harm anyone ever
        again. The kingdom and the precious gem remained safe, thanks to Chandraprabha's cleverness and courage.
      </p>
      <p>As Betal finished the story, he posed a question to King Vikramaditya: "Tell me, O King, what lesson do you draw
        from this story?"
  
        King Vikram, determined to remain silent, listened intently to the question. However, his curiosity got the best
        of him, and he couldn't resist answering the question. He responded, "The lesson I draw from this story is the
        importance of wit and intelligence in overcoming even the most dangerous of adversaries."
      </p>
      <p>Upon hearing Vikramaditya's response, Betal broke his silence and returned to the tree, leaving the king to start
        the journey once more. The cycle continued as Vikram sought to capture Betal once again, all while learning
        valuable lessons from the spirit's stories.</p>

    <font size="5" color="blue"><p>Vikram was the name of a king. He ruled over a city on the banks of
      Godavari River. He was very famous for his bravery and courage.
      People loved him because he always rendered justice.</p>
      <p>One day a sage came to the court of Vikram and gifted him a fruit.
        The king handed it over to his treasurer. Thereafter, the sage kept
        coming to the court daily to gift a fruit to the king. The king could not
        understand the reason behind this behaviour. But still he did not try to
        find out the sage's intentions.</p>
      <p>However, one morning, Vikram noticed a monkey sitting on the
        palace wall and gave the fruit to it. The monkey had started eating the
        fruit when suddenly a dazzling gem fell out of it. The King was very
        surprised. He immediately ordered his treasurer to get him all the
        fruits kept in the storage. The fruits had gone bad but when the king
        had them crushed, each one of them yielded a precious gem. The
        generous King donated all these gems to the poor and waited for the
        sage’s visit to the court.</p>
      <p>The next day, the sage visited the court of Vikram with yet another
        fruit.</p>
      <p>Vikram welcomed the sage and asked him "Your Holiness! Can you
        please tell me why you have been giving me such precious gifts?
        Without good reason, I cannot accept any gifts from you."</p>
      <p>The sage replied, "I need the help of a brave man for a spiritual goal.
        Will you help me?" Vikram readily agreed to this. So the sage said,
        "O King, please come to the burial ground on the next moonless
        night. It is at a distance of 20 miles from here. I will wait for you
        under a banyan tree." Vikram agreed to follow the instructions.</p>
     <p>On the said night, Vikram covered his head and body with a black
      cloth and unnoticed, reached the appointed spot in the forest. The
      sage was waiting for him and told him, "King Vikram! To the south
      of this forest is an old tamarind tree on which hangs a corpse upside
      down. Please bring it to me." The king immediately followed the
      sage’s orders and reached the tamarind tree. On finding a corpse
      there, he cut it loose. As soon as the corpse fell to the ground, it
      laughed loudly with a cackling sound. The king realized that it was a
      ghost. But the courageous king carried the body over his shoulders
      and started towards his capital. A short distance later, the ghost left
      Vikram’s shoulders and escaped to its original spot. The king
      climbed up the tree, brought down the ghost and placing it on his
      shoulders started walking again. "Who are you?" he asked the ghost.
      "I am Betaal" replied the ghost and in turn asked Vikram, "Why and
      where are you taking me away?"</p> 
     <p>"A sage has requested me to bring you to him," replied Vikram.
      Betaal did not have any objection to going with Vikram but he laid
      down a condition. "We have to cover a long distance and to relieve
      the tedious walk, I will tell you a story. But you should not utter even
      one word till we reach the destination. If by chance you utter
      anything, I will fly back to the tamarind tree. Do you agree to this?"
      asked Betaal. Vikram agreed to this and silently listened to Betaal’s story.  </p></font>

   <font size="5" color="blue"><p>King Vikram was given the duty of bringing Betal to a tantric. Betal traditionally means ‘evil spirit’. Each time
    Vikram tried to capture Betal, it told him a story that ended with a riddle. If Vikram could not answer the
    question correctly, Betal agreed to remain in captivity. But, if the king knew the answer and still kept quiet,
    his head would burst into a thousand pieces. And if King Vikram spoke, Betal would escape and return to his tree.

    King Vikramaditya reached the peepul tree and placed Betal on his shoulder once again. As they walked, Betal began
    to tell another story.</p>
  <p>“One afternoon, a man came into the court of King Roopsen, asking to be employed as the King’s bodyguard. He
    introduced himself as Birbal and promised to protect the King. After watching a display of his skills, the King
    readily agreed to give him the job.

    As Birbal was walking through the forest one day, he heard a strange and frightening scream. It was a demon who
    had descended from the mountains and was storming towards the King’s palace. Birbal drew his sword and jumped in
    the demon’s way.</p>
  <p>“I am here to banish the King and send him into the forest, away from luxuries and comfort. If he does not leave,
    I will curse his whole kingdom!” said the demon.

    Birbal was shocked at this news and asked, “Is there anything I can do to save both the King and Kingdom?”

    The demon roared, “You must find a suitable substitute for the King! One who is of a pure heart!”

    Birbal asked for a day to find a substitute and went home. When he told his family the truth, his son offered
    himself as a substitute for the King.

    The next morning, King Roopsen received word of the demon and arrived to the forest to try and stop Birbal and his
    son.</p>
 
  <p>Among the crowd was a young man named Uday. He came everyday to watch Sona fight. He observed her and soon learnt
    all the techniques and strategies that Sona used for her fights. He then presented himself to the King. When he
    fought Sona, and very cleverly and easily defeated her. The King then asked Uday from where he had learnt such
    skilled fighting technique. To this Uday told the king the truth that he had observed Sona and so learnt how to
    defeat her.</p>
  <p>Sona immediately replied, ‘You have defeated me, but I cannot marry you.’ To which Uday replied, ‘Yes, you should
    not marry me.’ The King and the queen were surprised at their decision.

    ‘Oh Vikram, now you tell me, why did she say that Uday cannot marry her even after he defeated her? If you do not
    speak even if you know the answer, you are not a king of Justice’, said Betal.</p>
  <p>Vikram replied, ‘Uday had learnt all the strategies by observing Sona fight. This makes Sona a guru or Uday’s
    teacher. In Hindu culture, a teacher cannot marry a student. Sona realized that Uday was first her student and
    then a suitor. Uday also thought in the same manner and thus decided not to marry Sona.’

    So Vikram had broken his silence with the reply and Betal flew back to the old tree while Vikram once again ran
    behind him with his sword.</p>
    <p>Hearing the correct answer, Betal fled back to the tree trunk. </p></font>

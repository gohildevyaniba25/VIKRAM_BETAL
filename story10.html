  <p>While the thief was paraded throughout the town, a trader’s daughter looked at him and fell in love with him. The
    trader’s daughter requested his father to save the life of the thief. However, King Randhir was determined to
    punish the robbers so he did not agree to spare the thief. Next day, the thief was taken for execution. When the
    thief heard about the trader’s daughter and her feelings for him, first he laughed and the he cried.</p>
  <p>“Can you tell Vikram, why did the thief first laugh and then cry?” Asked betal.</p>
  <p>Vikram replied “ The thief first laughed because he pitied on such a nice girl for falling in love with a crook,
    the thief then cried because he thought that had such a nice girl came into his life earlier, why would he walked
    this walk to execution.”</p>
  <p>Hearing the correct answer, Betal fled back to the tree trunk. </p>

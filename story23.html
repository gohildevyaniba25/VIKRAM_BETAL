      <p>Once upon a time, in a distant kingdom ruled by King Vikramaditya, there lived a wise sage named Som Sharma. He
        was known far and wide for his knowledge and wisdom. One day, King Vikramaditya decided to pay a visit to the sage
        to seek his counsel.
  
        As Vikramaditya reached the sage's hermitage, he found him sitting under a tree, deep in meditation. The king
        waited patiently until the sage opened his eyes and acknowledged his presence.
  
        "O Sage," said King Vikramaditya, "I have heard of your great wisdom, and I seek your guidance. I wish to know the
        secret of life's true purpose and meaning."</p>
        <p>
        The sage smiled and replied, "My King, the answer to your question lies in a mystical fruit known as 'The Fruit of
        Destiny.' It is said that this fruit can fulfill any wish of the one who possesses it. However, it is exceedingly
        rare and can only be found on a distant mountain, atop a perilous peak."
  
        Vikramaditya was intrigued by this revelation. He asked, "How can I obtain this Fruit of Destiny, O Sage?"
  
        Som Sharma continued, "To find the Fruit of Destiny, you must embark on a treacherous journey to the distant
        mountain. It is a journey filled with danger, but your determination and virtue will guide you."
      </p>
        <p>
          Without wasting any time, King Vikramaditya set out on the perilous journey. He faced wild beasts, treacherous
        terrain, and numerous challenges. After weeks of hardship and struggle, he finally reached the summit of the
        mountain.
  
        There, he found a single tree bearing a ripe, golden fruitâ€”the legendary Fruit of Destiny. Vikramaditya plucked
        the fruit and held it in his hands, feeling its otherworldly energy.
  
        However, as he stood on the mountaintop with the Fruit of Destiny in his grasp, he was filled with a sense of
        doubt and introspection. He wondered about the true purpose of his wish and whether he should use the fruit to
        fulfill a personal desire.
  
        In that moment of reflection, he remembered the wise sage's words about the importance of virtue and integrity.
        Realizing that he had a responsibility as a king to use his wish for the greater good, Vikramaditya made a
        selfless decision.
        </p>
        
        <p>Instead of making a personal wish, he wished for the well-being and prosperity of his kingdom and its people. With
          a humble heart, he placed the Fruit of Destiny back on the tree.
    
          Suddenly, the tree burst into a brilliant light, and a heavenly voice echoed, "Your selfless wish, O King, is
          granted."
    
          Vikramaditya returned to his kingdom, and true to the divine promise, his land prospered, and his people lived in
          peace and happiness.
        </p> 
        <p>
        This story of "The Fruit of Destiny" teaches us the valuable lesson that selflessness and the well-being of others
        are more important than personal gain. King Vikramaditya's virtuous choice reflected his wisdom and the true
        purpose of his leadership.

    <p>In a prosperous town, there lived a wealthy merchant named Dhananjay. He was known far and wide for his riches
      and was considered one of the wealthiest men in the region. However, Dhananjay was infamous for his insatiable
      greed. No matter how much wealth he accumulated, he always craved for more.

      One day, as Dhananjay was walking through the bustling marketplace, he overheard a conversation that piqued his
      interest. The townsfolk were talking about a sage who resided in a distant forest. This sage was rumored to have a
      magical fruit that could fulfill any wish.
    </p>
    <p>Driven by his never-ending greed, Dhananjay decided that he must possess this magical fruit at any cost. He
      embarked on a journey to find the sage, and after weeks of travel, he finally reached the hermit's abode.

      Upon meeting the sage, Dhananjay expressed his desire to acquire the magical fruit. The sage, after assessing
      Dhananjay's intentions, reluctantly agreed to grant him the fruit but warned him about its power. He emphasized
      that it could only be used three times and must be used wisely.</p>
    <p>Dhananjay, blinded by his greed, couldn't fathom the importance of using the fruit judiciously. He eagerly took
      the fruit and made his first wish for a grand palace. Instantly, a magnificent palace appeared before him,
      fulfilling his desire.

      Elated with his newfound wealth, Dhananjay's greed knew no bounds. He quickly used his second wish to amass a vast
      fortune of gold and jewels. His riches multiplied manifold, and he became the wealthiest man in the entire
      kingdom.</p>

    <p>However, his insatiable greed led him to use his final wish recklessly. He wished to become the king of the land,
      believing that ultimate power would bring him unparalleled happiness. In an instant, the king's crown adorned his
      head, and he found himself on the royal throne.

      As the new king, Dhananjay reveled in his power and riches. However, his subjects soon realized that their king
      cared only for himself and his wealth. The kingdom's prosperity began to wane as Dhananjay neglected his duties
      and the welfare of his people.</p>
    <p>The sage, witnessing the downfall of Dhananjay, decided to intervene. He appeared before the greedy king and
      reminded him of the warning about the fruit's limited wishes. Dhananjay was now remorseful and realized the
      consequences of his selfishness.

      Regretfully, he used his final wish to undo all the previous wishes and return to his former life as a humble
      merchant. The grand palace, the immense wealth, and the throne vanished, leaving him with nothing but the memory
      of his folly.</p>
    <p>As Betal concluded the story, he posed a question to King Vikramaditya: "What lesson does this tale impart, O
      King?"

      Vikramaditya remained silent, contemplating the lesson learned from the story. He recognized that greed could lead
      to one's downfall and that one should value contentment over limitless wealth and power.</p>
    <p>But just as the king was about to answer, Betal broke his silence, slipped out of Vikram's grasp, and returned to
      his tree in the cemetery, leaving Vikram to start the quest anew. The relentless cycle of capturing Betal
      continued, with each story serving as a lesson in wisdom and morality.</p>
